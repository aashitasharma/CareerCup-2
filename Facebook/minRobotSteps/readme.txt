 * 
 * A robot has to move in a grid which is in the form of a matrix. It can go to 
 * 1.) A(i,j)--> A(i+j,j) (Down) 
 * 2.) A(i,j)--> A(i,i+j) (Right) 
 * 
 * Given it starts at (1,1) and it has to go to A(m,n), 
 * find the minimum number of STEPS it has to take to get to (m,n) and write 
 * public static int minSteps(int m,int n) 
 * 
 * For instance to go from (1,1) to m=3 and n=2 it has to take 
 * (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (3, 2) i.e. 2 steps
 *
