 * 
 * Question: Given a sequence of positive integers A and an integer T, return whether there is a continuous sequence of A that sums up to exactly T 
 * Example 
 * [23, 5, 4, 7, 2, 11], 20. Return True because 7 + 2 + 11 = 20 
 * [1, 3, 5, 23, 2], 8. Return True because 3 + 5 = 8 
 * [1, 3, 5, 23, 2], 7 Return False because no sequence in this array adds up to 7
 */

 Solution 1:
 -----------
 Implemented algorithm which works on array of positive numbers.
 Time Complexity = O(n)

 Solution 2: (TODO)
 -----------
 Need to implement algorithm which can work even for array having negative numbers.
 Can be implemented by creating a cumulative sum array.
