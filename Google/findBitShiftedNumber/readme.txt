 * 
 * Given unsigned integer 'x', write an algorithm that returns 
 * unsigned integer 'y' such that it has the same number of bits 
 * set as 'x' and is not equal to 'x' and the distance |x-y| is minimized. 
 * 
 * Example: 
 * x: 01 
 * y: 10 
 * 
 * Note that one bit is set and 'x' is not equal 'y'. 
 * You may assume that x is positive integer between zero and 2^32-2;
